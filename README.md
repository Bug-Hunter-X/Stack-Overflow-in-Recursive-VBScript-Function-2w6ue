This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: stack overflow due to improper handling of recursion. The `bug.vbs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from the lack of a robust base case in the recursive function, leading to excessive function calls exceeding the call stack limit.  The solution demonstrates how to resolve this by implementing a proper termination condition.
